### How to generate api route docs.
In order to generate your api route docs, run the following command:

```bash
npx insomnia-documenter --config ./documentation.json
```

Then, you can run a server with your brand new generated docs with:

```bash
npx serve
```

Now it's as simple as opening a new tab on your favourite browser and accessing the link:
> http://localhost:3000
